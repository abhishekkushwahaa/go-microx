# Introduction

Welcome to **go-microx**, a powerful CLI tool designed to streamline the creation of scalable microservices architectures in Go.

Building microservices from scratch can be a daunting task involving repetitive boilerplate, complex configuration, and architectural decisions. **go-microx** solves this by providing an interactive setup that scaffolds a production-ready environment in seconds.

## Key Principles

- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce setup time from hours to minutes.
- **Best Practices**: Generate code based on proven architectural patterns.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a uniform structure across all your microservices.
- **Flexibility**: Choose the tools you love (Gin, Fiber, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).

## Why go-microx?

Unlike generic scaffolding tools, **go-microx** is tailored specifically for Go microservices. It doesn't just give you a folder; it gives you a **complete ecosystem** including:

- **Pre-defined Industry Templates**: E-commerce, Video Streaming, Food Delivery.
- **Router Selection**: Support for Gin, Fiber, Chi, Echo, and more.
- **Database Integration**: One-click setup for SQL and NoSQL databases.
- **Containerization**: Ready-to-use Docker and Docker Compose files.
- **Observability**: Built-in support for logging and configuration.
